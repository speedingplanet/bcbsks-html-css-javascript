# Lab 03

Working with functions

## Part 01

* Write a function that encapsulates the code from the previous lab.
  * Replace the code in the loop with a call to the function

## Part 02

* Write a function that greets someone by name. For example: 'Hello, John!'
  * If a name is not given, it should return an appropriate, if generic, greeting. Example: 'Hello, my friend!'
  * Prefer using default argument values, though you could get this done with conditionals
* Write a function that takes two arguments
  * The first argument is an operation as a string 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'
  * The rest of the arguments are a stack of numbers to apply the operation to
  * Return the results of processing all the values
