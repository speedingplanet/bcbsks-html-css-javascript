# Lab 06

Working with arrays

## Part 1

Copy your code here from lab 05.  
Replace whatever code you used in part 3 to add a name to the list with a call to `array.push` or `array.splice`

## Part 2
Replace the `for` loop used in lab 05, part 1 to generate the unordered list of names with either `array.forEach` or `array.map`.  
Replace the `for` loop used in part 4 to filter the array with a call to `array.filter`
