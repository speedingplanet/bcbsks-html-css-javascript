# Lab 02

Working with loops and conditionals

- Add `index.js` to `lab-02.html` using a script tag with a type of "module"
- In `index.js`, import `people` from `data.js`.
- Loop over each person in `people` and print their name to the console.
- Add a conditional to the loop that prints out 'Hey, your last name starts with "s"!' as appropriate
  - `String.startsWith` may help, or regular expressions, or even `String.includes`
- Add a conditional that skips over anyone named 'Jenny'
- Add a conditional that stops on the name 'John Doe'
  - Update `data.js` to test that last condition
