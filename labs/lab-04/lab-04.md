Working with divs, spans, and CSS styling

## Part 1

Build an HTML widget that has the following styling:

- An outer div which is 200px x 200px with a solid black border
- Two inner divs
  - The upper div functions similar to a title bar. Bold text, larger, centered, bottom border, and a light gray background
    - As test text, use your name
    - Specify only the bottom border with the CSS property `border-bottom`. Takes the same values
      as `border`.
  - The lower div is for content: some padding off of the sides
    - Add an unordered list with your city, state, and birthdate
    - **Challenge** Remove the bullets from the unordered list

## Part 2

Create somthing similar to the above, but use Bootstrap's [Card component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/card/)
to get a similar effect, rather than writing the CSS code yourself.
